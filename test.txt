But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
                         
          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
                         
          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
                         
          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
                         
          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.
                         
          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
                         
          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
                         
          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.
                         
          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
                         
          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.

          The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
          Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
          a series of echoes.
                         
          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.

          INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY
                         
          The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
          headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
          and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.
                         
          ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
          A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes.
                         
          INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY
                         
          Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office,
          which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus.
                         
          His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up
          at Ansen as he enters.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           I'm on hold with the INS.
                          (COVERS MICROPHONE)
           Don't you think we should double
           check the triangulation before we
                          CALL ANYBODY-
                         
                          ANSEN
           We have double checked it.
                         
          Someone finally picks up the line.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Yes. I'm trying to reach-
           (pause, listens)
           No, I don't think you understand how
           serious this is.
                          (PAUSE)
           Because if you did, we'd be having
           this conversation in person.
                         
          He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.
                         
                          ANSEN
           What did they say?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They said we should look out the
           window.
                         
          Ansen steps to the window and looks out:
                         
          In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
          the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of
          the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his
          building.

          INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY
                         
          Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.
                         
          The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
          some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
          guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Is that really necessary?
                         
          One of the NSA agents leans forward.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You've been complaining for years
           that the government doesn't take
           your project seriously enough, Doctor.
                          (SMILES)
           You can't have it both ways.
                         
          Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
          On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.
                         
          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
          star circling into the black hole.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           We know that, Doctor. What we don't
           know is why, according to your
           numbers, this event took place right
           here in our own solar system.
                         
          Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
          rest of our solar system around the black hole.
                         
                          ANSEN
           It didn't. Because if it had we'd
           all be dead by now.
                         
          On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
          consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
          into orbit around its new master.
                         
                          ANSEN (CONT'D)
           Which leaves only one explanation:
           The signal traveled through a

           wormhole. A gateway to a distant
           corner of the universe. The black
           hole is on the far side.
                         
          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
          corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
          gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           I've read your book, Doctor. You
           said that wormholes are impossible.
                         
                          ANSEN
           There is nothing quite as satisfying
           as being proved utterly wrong.
                          (SMILES)
           I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
           naturally. Not for more than a few
           billionths of a second. It would
           have to be... stabilized.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Stabilized by what?
                         
          Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           We don't have any way to answer that
           question.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
                          (IGNORES HIM)
           You're not under peer review here,
           Doctor. I don't care about your
           reputation. I need to know how that
           thing got there. Now.
                         
          Ansen finally speaks up.
                         
                          ANSEN
           If you're worried about an invasion,
           I would start drafting the articles
           of surrender.
                          (SMILES)
           Whoever they are, if they can build
           a wormhole, they could erase us in
           the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
           also means we have nothing they could
           be interested in.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Then why is it there?

                          ANSEN
           I don't know. Maybe it's an
           invitation. A chance to commune
           with an advanced species.
                         
          The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You don't agree?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
                          (DELICATE)
           No. I don't think we can assume an
           alien intelligence built the wormhole.
                          (CHANGES TACK)
           But the opportunity it represents is
           incredible. We could explore parts
           of the universe we never dreamt of
           reaching in our lifetimes.
                         
          The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who
          steps out of the room.
                         
                          ANSEN

          outraged, turns back to his boss.

          A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt
          road, smoke pouring out of its open hood. A dozen MEN in
          BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus.
                         
          A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving
          his two SONS in the car. This is COOPER. He joins the
          ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine.

           Long way to come by bus. I thought
           you guys would have a plane.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           We did. Ran out of parts for it.
           You know anything about diesels?

           A little.
                         
          Cooper steps to the engine compartment.
                         
          The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH,
          10, watching them. He wanders over.

           able to help us out?
                         
          Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the
          ballplayer.
                         
                          MURPH

          The ballplayer frowns: smartass kid.
                         
          After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver,
          who tries the engine. It turns over once, then STARTS.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           Sure appreciate the help.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SHRUGS)
           You don't make it, my boys won't get
           to see you lose.
                         
          The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away,
          we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for
          the first time:
                         
          WORLD FAMOUS NEW YORK YANKEES
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          Earth spins, lazily. From this height, it looks much the
          same as it has done for thousands of years.
                         
          Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth.
                         
          The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward.
          Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of
          fragments.
                         
          EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT
                         
          An old minor league stadium. The stands are barely halfway
          full. Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD,
          60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout.
                         
          Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn.
                         
                          DONALD
           Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
           I want a hot dog.
           8.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's a hot dog?
                         
          Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and
          fans look up at the night sky:
                         
          A bright blue streak is tearing across it. It's beautiful.
                         
                          TOM
           Is that a comet, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           (shakes his head)
           Satellite. Big one. Probably
           Chinese.
                         
          Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in
          the upper atmosphere.
                         
          After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
          everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
                         
          Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop
          fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.
                         
          INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. His father-
          in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back.
                         
                          DONALD
           Those clowns would get their asses
           handed to them by the ballplayers I
           grew up watching.
                         
                          COOPER
           You ruin it for the boys when you
           talk like that.
                         
                          DONALD
           I'm not doing my grandkids any favors
           by lying to them. They're growing
           up watching lousy baseball.
                         
                          COOPER
           They didn't have any baseball at all
           when I was a kid.
                         
          That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           9.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING
                         
          The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea
          of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. Cooper walks out
          of his house, still eating his breakfast.
                         
          Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke
          in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING.
                         
                          DONALD
           Nelson's burning up his crops. Found
           some of the blight on the okra.
                         
          Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting
          fire to the crop.
                         
                          COOPER
           I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SHRUGS)
           Better safe than sorry.
           (looks at him)
           You've got to take the boys to school.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something wrong with your truck?
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SMILES)
           Parent-teacher conference day.
                         
          Cooper bends his head in dismay.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
           single, you know.
                         
                          COOPER
           What does that have to do with
           anything?
                         
                          DONALD
           We're supposed to be repopulating
           the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
           Besides, the boys could do with a
           woman in their lives.
                         
          The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper
          pulls away before Donald can continue.
                         
          EXT. ROAD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing
          over an ancient comic book in the back seat.
           10.
                         
          Cooper turns around to break it up.
                         
          BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole.
                         
          EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Get the spare, Tom.
                         
                          TOM
           That is the spare.
                         
                          COOPER
           All right. We'll use the patch kit.
                         
          He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks
          very glum.
                         
                          MURPH
           I... I think the patch kit might not
           be there...
           (off his look)
           Because I was using it for my bike.
                         
          Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
                         
                          COOPER
           Murph's law.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's that?
                         
          Tom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad.
                         
                          TOM
           The kid doesn't even know what he
           was named after...
                         
          Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph's law means what can go wrong
           will go wrong.
                         
          Murph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Find something to patch it with.
                         
                          TOM
           How am I supposed to do that?
           11.
                         
                          COOPER
           Figure it out. I'm not always going
           to be here to help you.
                         
          Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is
          looking out over the river.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is that really why I'm named Murph,
           dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
           mean that. It means what can happen
           will happen. All kinds of things.
           Good or bad. And that's the way you
           want it to be.
                         
                          MURPH
           Why?
                         
                          COOPER
           Because if nothing ever happened to
           you then you wouldn't learn anything.
                         
          Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
          looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
          his son to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
          can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
          then soars off over the fields behind them.
                         
          Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
          laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
          back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Get in.
                         
          Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling
          with the jack.
                         
                          TOM
           What about the tire?
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper
          can push it on three good tires.
           12.
                         
          Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to
          the directional antenna.
                         
          Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning
          the horizon.
                         
                          TOM
                          OVER THERE-
                         
          To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears,
          flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel--
                         
          EXT. RIVER -- DAY
                         
          The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the
          river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development
          in the valley below, planted over with corn.
                         
          Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still
          hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings,
          like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
          tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes
          the computer from him and fires up emulation software.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
           cells could power an entire farm.
                          (TO TOM)
           Take the wheel.
                         
          Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Keep it pointed right at it, OK?
                         
          Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop,
          trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen
          fills with Cyrillic characters.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
                         
          Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
          of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
          over with corn.
                         
          They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
          harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.
                         
          BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of
          the combine.
           13.
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart
          a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
          SMASHES through an old picket fence.
                         
          Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control
          circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to
          climb into the foothills of the Sierras.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone
          soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he
          concentrates on the laptop.
                         
                          TOM
                          (UNSURE)
           Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Almost got it. Don't slow down.
                         
          In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone
          plummets from view.
                         
                          TOM
           DAD.
                         
          Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of
          the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.
                         
          Tom locks up the brakes.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.
                         
          Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out
          next to him, still pointing the Pringles can.
                         
                          TOM
           We lost it.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILING)
           No we didn't.
           14.
                         
          Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a
          couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad.
          The huge drone banks and turns in response.
                         
          As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over
          them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the
          valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back.
          It's a beautiful sight.
                         
          Cooper crouches next to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You want to give it a whirl?
                         
          Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and
          moves his fingers gingerly across the pad.
                         
          In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in
          the valley below.
                         
          For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone
          dancing through the valley below.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Set her down in the valley -- there,
           next to the river.
                         
          Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins
          guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.
                         
          EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY
                         
          The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct
          golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,
                         
          Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save
          for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.
                         
          Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.
                         
                          TOM
           How long do you think it's been up
           there, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Chinese mission control went down
           same as us, twenty years ago. It's
           been up there ever since.
                         
                          TOM
           What was it doing flying so low?
                         
          Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
           15.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was looking for something.
           Intercepted some kind of signal.
                          (SHRUGS)
           It's been at eighty thousand feet.
           Sun probably cooked its brain.
                         
          Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access
          patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch.
          Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a
          small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot.
                         
          Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are you going to do with it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Reprogram it. Give it something
           socially responsible to do like drive
           a combine or a tractor.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (QUIET)
           Couldn't we just let it go? It's
           not hurting anyone.
                         
          Cooper looks down at his son. Good kid.
                         
                          COOPER
           We need all the help we can get,
           Murph. This thing has to adapt,
           just like the rest of us.
                         
          Cooper gently pries the control module out.
                         
          EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in
          front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half
          of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
          efficient-looking man, shakes his hand.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
           is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
           16.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           So we've gotten Tom's score back.
           Congratulations. He's going to make
           an excellent farmer.
                         
          The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper,
          who looks taken aback.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about college?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           The University of California only
           accepts a few hundred students a
           year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
           realistic.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're ruling out college for him
           now? He's only fifteen.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
           simply isn't high enough.
                         
                          COOPER
           What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
                          (BEAT)
           30-inch inseam?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm not sure I see--
                         
                          COOPER
           You're telling me you need two numbers
           to measure your own ass, but just
           one to measure my son's future?
                         
          Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the
          principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I understand you're a well-educated
           man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?
                         
                          COOPER
           Engineer.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Frankly, the world doesn't need any
           more engineers. We didn't run out
           of trains or television sets or
           satellites.
                          (BEAT)
           We ran out of food.
           17.
                         
          Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
           And I'm sure your son Tom is going
           to make a fine one.
                          (SMILES BENIGNLY)
           We're a caretaker generation. But
           things are getting better. Maybe
           your grandchildren will be able to
           attend college.
                         
          Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Are we done?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
           that Murph brought a book to school
           about the lunar landings.
                         
          He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the
          cover across the desk to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
           the pictures.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           This is one of the old federal
           textbooks. We've replaced them with
           corrected versions.
                         
                          COOPER
           Corrected?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           The new textbooks explain that the
           Apollo lunar missions were faked in
           order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't believe we went to the
           moon?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           I believe it was a brilliant piece
           of propaganda. The Soviets spent
           years trying to build rockets and
           other useless machines.
                         
                          COOPER
           "Useless machines"?
           18.
                         
          Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
           wastefulness and excess that the
           20th century represented. Your
           children would be better off learning
           about this planet, rather than reading
           fantasies about leaving it.
                         
          Cooper is silent for a long moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of those useless machines they
           used to make was called an MRI. If
           we had any of them left the doctors
           might have been able to find the
           cyst in my wife's brain before she
           died, rather than afterwards. And
           then my kids could have been raised
           by two parents, instead of me and
           their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.
                         
          Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger.
          Most of it, anyway.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You ever consider the best thing for
           the world and humanity might have
           been for us to part company?
                         
          Cooper gets up to leave.
                         
          INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY
                         
          Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together.
          He PUNCHES the wheel.
                         
          The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment
          in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           Got a call from Riggs, down in
           Galveston. Says some of the tractors
           you built him went haywire last night.
                         
                          COOPER
           Just tell him to power down the
           controllers for a couple minutes.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           I did. He wants you to come down in
           person anyway. Says he found
           something you should take a look at.
           19.
                         
          Cooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration.
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls
          a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach.
          The radio crackles to life.
                         
                          COOPER
           Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission

           AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (O.S.)
           Permission granted. Welcome to the
           sovereign nation of Texas.
                         
          Coop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland.
                         
          EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY
                         
          Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying
          to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in
          the soft sand.
                         
          A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.
                         
          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                         
          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.
                         
          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault
          code and resets the computer.
                         
          The man jogs over to meet him.
                         
                          RIGGS
           Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
           took off last night, looking for
           something.
           (points to dunes)
           Looks like they found it, too. I
           thought you were the man to see it.
                         
          Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.
                         
          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming
          vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping
          at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
           20.
                         
          As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,
          trying to reach the crater.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down
          into the crater.
                         
          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a
          satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.
                         
          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He
          rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk.
                         
                          RIGGS
                          (FROM ABOVE)
           You think it's an alien?
                         
          Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint,
          familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:
                         
          The stars and stripes of the old federal government.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not exactly.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe
          out of the crater and onto the beach.
                         
          Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.
                         
                          COOPER
           Space probe. Never seen one like
           it, though. Looks like it's been to
           hell and back.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
                         
                          RIGGS
           How do you think it wound up here?
                         
                          COOPER
           Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
           would have been shot down by the
           Chinese twenty years ago.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
           21.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat
          of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.
                         
          The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper
          works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives
          up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well I don't know what the hell it's
           made of, but I can't crack it open.
                         
                          DONALD
           Good. Clear it off the table so I
           can serve dinner.
                         
          Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           What happened this time?
                         
                          MURPH
           I got suspended. Paul said anyone
           who believed we went to the moon was
           an idiot. So I hit him.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good boy. Hand me the scanner.
                         
          Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
          purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
          probe and turns on the power.
                         
          Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
          the controls and it PULSES.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
           Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
           Hold on. I've got something.
                         
          Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
          the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:
                         
          An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
          impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where is that, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe.
           22.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Where the hell did you come from?
                         
          Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
           and have it melted down. Might be
           some copper inside.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what about its mission? What
           about the information onboard?
                         
                          COOPER
           There's no one for it to report to.
           NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
           It got home too late.
                         
          Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot
          unceremoniously onto the table.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
                         
          The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at
          the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer.
                         
                          DONALD
           I heard your meeting at the school
           didn't go so well.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head in disgust.
                         
                          COOPER
           Maybe it's better for everyone to
           forget what they did back then.
           Reminds us how far we've fallen.
                         
                          DONALD
           (looks down,)
           When I was kid, it felt like they
           made something new every day. Some
           gadget or idea.
                          (SMILES)
           Like every day was Christmas.
                          (BEAT)
           But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
           billion people. Just try to imagine
           that. Every last one of them trying
           to have it all.
                         
          Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands.
           23.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           The truth is this world isn't that
           bad. In a lot of ways its better.
           Tom will be all right, whether he
           goes to college or not.
                         
                          COOPER
           It doesn't bother me that he can't
           go. It bothers me that he doesn't
           care.
                         
                          DONALD
           Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
           this world just fine. You're the
           one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
           belong here. You were born forty
           years too late, or forty years too
           early -- I don't know. My daughter
           knew it, god bless her. And your
           kids know it, too.
                         
          Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops,
          one hand on the frame.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           You were good at something and you
           never got a chance to do anything
           with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
           that's not your kids' fault.
                         
          Donald pushes out the screen door.
                         
          Cooper looks at his beer. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He
          stares up at the ceiling. This is his life.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.
                         
          Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding
          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.
                         
          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.
           24.
                         
          The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a
          DEAFENING SCREAM.
                         
          Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He
          hits it with the paddles. No result.
                         
          He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and
          AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table
          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front
          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.
                         
          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It
          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.
                         
          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once
          again, the movement shuts it up.
                         
          EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door.
          It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt.
          After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.
                         
          Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph
          looks up, sees the stars overhead.
                         
                          MURPH
           Try a different direction.
                         
          As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then
          picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps
          it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a fail-safe. It's going to
           annoy us into taking it home.
                         
          Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins
          SHRIEKING again.
                         
                          TOM
           What are we going to do?
                         
          Cooper gets a rope.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to get some sleep.
                         
          He begins tying the rope around the probe.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
           25.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
          looks up at Cooper, smiling.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are we doing today?
                         
                          COOPER
           You're staying here and cleaning the
           house.
                         
          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I told you, Murph. There's no one
           to take it back to.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what if there is, dad? What if
           there's something we can salvage?
                         
          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
                         
          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.
                         
          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.
                         
          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.
                         
          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY
                         
          The tiny plane follows the mountains south.
                         
          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
                         
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.
           26.
                         
          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.
                         
          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.
                         
                          COOPER
           Got any diesel?
                         
                          OLD MAN
           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.
                         
          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.
                         
          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
                         
          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
                         
                          MURPH
           I think it's home.
                         
          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
                         
          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.
                         
          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.
                         
                          MURPH
           Dad, what are these things?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know. Don't touch them.
           27.
                         
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.
                         
          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.
                         
          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.
                         
          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.
                         
          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
                         
          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
                         
          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Careful. There's some kind of
           underground facility here. We
           might...
                         
          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
                         
          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is it still... alive?
                         
                          COOPER
           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
           28.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I think we need to go, Murph.
                         
                          MURPH
           But can't we take it back? You could
           fix it up, get him to do chores.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. I don't know what this place
           is, but we're leaving.
                         
          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
                         
          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                         
          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
                         
          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Tell the boy to stop hitting me.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (IGNORING HIM)
           Hit him in the back of the neck.
                         
          Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I wouldn't do that.
                         
          A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
          tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
          she's pointing at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           We were just looking for salvage.
                         
                          BRAND
           Is that what they call stealing these
           days?
                         
                          COOPER
           I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
           29. 
                         
                          BRAND
           It doesn't.
                          (TO ROBOT)
           You want to let them go, Tars, or do
           you want some help with your work?
                         
          The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely.
          Then lets him go.
                         
                          COOPER
           You've got me wrong, lady.
                         
                          BRAND
           Really? You're not the kind of guy
           who turns a combat marine with a
           supercomputer for a brain into a
           riding lawn mower?
                         
          Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Get back in your little plane, go
           back to your farming commune. And
           don't come back.
                         
          Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles.
                         
                          TARS
           Don't forget your gun.
                         
                          COOPER
           (points at Tars)
           Word of advice -- careful with that
           thing. When the war was over, they
           didn't know when to stop fighting.
                         
                          BRAND
           I'd trust him a lot more than I'd
           trust you. Keep moving.
                         
          Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.
                         
          Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
          Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
          He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
                         
                          COOPER
           Wait a second--
                         
          Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls
          out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
                         
                          BRAND
           Get it inside.
                          (MORE)
           30.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           (points rifle at Cooper)
           You too. We'll figure out what to
           do with you later.
                         
          Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a
          huge, reinforced service elevator.
                         
          INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide
          diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below
          the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.
                         
                          COOPER
           Now who's stealing from who?
                         
                          BRAND
           This doesn't belong to you.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're right. It belongs to NASA,
           which shut down thirty years ago
           when the federal government ran out
           of money.
                         
          Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the
          bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand
          motions for Cooper to step forward.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the
          center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket.
          Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.
                         
                          COOPER
           Who are you people?
                         
                          BRAND
                          (WRY)
           The government gave us plenty of
           practice looking for our own funding.
           (gestures with rifle)
           Keep moving.
                         
          Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled
          with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS
          converge around Tars.
                         
          An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this
          is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years
          earlier.
           31.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           I found them outside with it. It
           looks like six. Maybe seven. I
           can't tell from the radiation damage.
                         
          The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.
                         
                          OLD ENGINEER
           Where did you find it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Galveston.
                         
                          BRAND'S FATHER
           (thinking it over)
           Of course. It must have been looking
           for Canaveral.
                         
          Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE,
          40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.
                         
                          COOPER
           Canaveral's been gone for thirty
           years.
                         
          Brand ignores him.
                         
          Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's not responding to the handshake.
           I can't open anything on primary.
                         
          Brand looks up at Cooper.
                         
                          BRAND
           What did you do to it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing. I got something off of it.
                         
          Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall
          with a battery powered defibrillator.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (TO BRAND)
